ü§ó Hello First-time Contributors
There are lot of resources (articles, courses, videos) available for getting started with git and GitHub you can search and follow any of the resource you like.

You can pick any of the issues from Issues or If you feel like it needs extra feature or if you find bug, you can create your own issue.
You can drop a comment on issue saying "Hi Ghanender, let me work on this " to avoid multiple people working on the same PR.
Lastly, It is fine if you mess something up. If there is anything wrong in the PR I will let you know how to fix that in comments of the PR.
